I haven't worked on / run this for a few months; memory of how it works is a bit hazy :D

To test it out you want to download an iCal dump from iDoneThis, and call it sample.ics. Then when you're running a server you should be able to hit /sample, or /edition if you're doing it with a proper feed URL.
